The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the command `vite build` not being found, resulting in "Command failed with exit code 127" error.

**Solution:**
1. The error indicates that the build command is trying to run `vite build` but is unable to locate the `vite` command.
2. To resolve this issue, `vite` needs to be installed as a dependency in your project.
3. Make sure that `vite` is listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file. If it's not there, you need to add it by running:
   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```
4. Once `vite` is added to your project dependencies, commit the `package.json` file to the repository.
5. After that, trigger a new build on Netlify to ensure the changes take effect.
