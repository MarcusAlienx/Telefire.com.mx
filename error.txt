The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 62](#L62) shows that the build failed to load the Vite configuration file at `/opt/build/repo/vite.config.ts`, resulting in an error importing the package `@vitejs/plugin-react` in the Vite configuration file, as indicated in [lines 63 to 74](#L63-L74).

### Solution
1. **Verify Package and Configuration File**:
   - Ensure that the package `@vitejs/plugin-react` is included in the `package.json` file and is installed in the project dependencies.
   - Confirm that the `vite.config.ts` configuration file is present in the root of the project directory and properly committed to the repository.

2. **Resolve Dependency Issue**:
   - If the package `@vitejs/plugin-react` is missing, you need to install it by running:
     ```bash
     npm install @vitejs/plugin-react
     ```
   
   - If the package is already in the `package.json` file and installed, you might need to check the import statement in the `vite.config.ts` file to ensure it is correct.

3. **Adjust Vite Configuration**:
   - Update the Vite configuration file (`vite.config.ts`) to correctly import `@vitejs/plugin-react` or resolve any dependencies issues within the configuration.

Following these steps should help resolve the Vite configuration related build failure.
