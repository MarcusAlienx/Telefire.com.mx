The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 61](#L61): The build failed because the command `vite build` could not be found.

### Solution
The error `bash: line 1: vite: command not found` indicates that the `vite` command is not available during the build process. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the `vite` command is accessible in the build environment.

1. Verify that the `vite` package is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file of the project.
2. If `vite` is a development dependency, make sure the package is not mistakenly listed under `devDependencies`.
3. If `vite` is a dependency, ensure it is included in the `node_modules` directory by committing the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file to the repository.
4. If `vite` is a global package required for the build, you may need to install it globally in the build settings or include it as a dependency in the project.
5. To fix the command not found issue, you might need to adjust the build command to include the path to the `vite` binary. Alternatively, you could install `vite` locally before running the build command.

After addressing these points, you should be able to run the build successfully.
