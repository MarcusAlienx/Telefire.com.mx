The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to an unsupported engine version for the 'cross-env' package. The package 'cross-env@10.0.0' requires Node version '>=20', but the current Node version is 'v18.20.8'.

**Solution:**
1. **Verify Package or File:**
   Ensure that the 'cross-env@10.0.0' package is listed in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.

2. **Update Node Version:**
   As the 'cross-env' package requires Node version '>=20', you need to update the Node version in your build environment.
   
   - Update the Node version in your project to a version that is compatible with 'cross-env@10.0.0'.
   
   - If Node version management is needed in your project, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) for changing Node versions.
