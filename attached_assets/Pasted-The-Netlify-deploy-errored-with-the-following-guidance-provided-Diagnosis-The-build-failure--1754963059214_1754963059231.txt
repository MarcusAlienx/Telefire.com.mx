The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is occurring because the command `vite` is not found when running the build script.

**Solution:**
1. Since `vite` is not found, you need to ensure that Vite is installed or listed as a dependency in your project.
2. Check if Vite is listed in your project's `package.json` file. If it's missing, you need to add it as a dependency by running:
   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```
3. After adding Vite as a dependency, make sure to commit the changes to your repository.
4. Retry the build on Netlify to verify if the issue is resolved.
